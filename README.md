# Persistence-of-Vision-Robot
One of the interesting theory known to us since our childhood is how we can differentiate between pictures and videos. Persistence of Vision, POV is the property of retention of a visual image for a short period of time (1/16th of a second in case of human eye),even after the removal of the stimulus that produced it: the illusion of movement when viewing motion pictures. In present scenario, the most important issue is the sustainable use of energy. The motive of this project was to make an LED display to display a message, using only a row of LEDs. A two dimensional POV display is accomplished by means of rapidly moving a single row of LEDs along a linear or circular path. The effect is that the image (a set of characters in this project), is perceived as a whole by the viewer as long as the entire path is completed during the visual persistence time of the human.Talking of the theory behind this POV display made it easy to be realized!!....An array of 9x5 LEDs is made such that with a given time delay, all the five columns are glowing in their respective order to show letters or words as per the input given.
For example: for the letter ‘A’ – Firstly, 2nd to 8th LEDs are kept high for the first column; then with a delay, 1st and 5th LEDs are kept high and same for the next 3 columns. The last column is again the same as first column.
